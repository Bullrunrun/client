# About the Game
This game involves capturing cows by clicking on them, with each successful capture earning the player 5 points. When the points accumulate to 20, the game difficulty increases; at 30 points, the player will enter the Super Hell mode. The game is currently in the testing phase, where players can claim tokens for free and start playing without any token consumption. After the test phase, we will enable the option to withdraw tokens and add more interactive features.
Due to personal limitations, it is challenging to incorporate the contract interaction logic into the game within the specified time. Therefore, if given the opportunity, I will continue to refine this game and improve the game animations.
